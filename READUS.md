# Analysis of Hermes Service and its Contribution to SchoolPilot

  ## Overview of Hermes

  Hermes is the communication service for the SchoolPilot platform, designed to facilitate communication
  between schools, teachers, guardians, and students. It's built with a dual subsystem architecture.

  Key Features of Hermes

  The service provides several core capabilities that directly support SchoolPilot's mission:

   1. Real-time Communication: One-to-one and group messaging with 1-hour WebSocket sessions
   2. Daily Notes & Announcements: Dedicated functionality to send updates from teachers to guardians about
      students
   3. Media Sharing: Live photo and video sharing capabilities with asynchronous media processing
   4. Push Notifications: For keeping parents engaged with important updates
   5. Communication Rules: Enforces proper communication boundaries (e.g., Director ↔ Student not allowed)

  # How Hermes Contributes to SchoolPilot Goals

  Based on the schoolpilot.md documentation and the Hermes service architecture, here's how Hermes
  contributes to achieving SchoolPilot's objectives:

   1. Strengthening Parent-School Relationships:
      - The "Parent Communication App (SP Connect Integration)" mentioned in schoolpilot.md specifically
        calls for daily notes, live photo/video sharing, and real-time messaging
      - Hermes directly implements these features with daily notes functionality, live photo/video sharing,
        and secure real-time messaging capabilities

   2. Enhancing Student Management:
      - SchoolPilot's "Smart Student Management" includes progress tracking and reporting
      - Hermes connects to the Student Management Service (Athena) to send progress reports and attendance
        alerts to parents
      - The communication rules ensure appropriate communication flows (Staff ↔ Student, Staff ↔ Guardian)
        while blocking inappropriate ones (Director ↔ Student)

   3. Supporting Teacher Efficiency:
      - SchoolPilot aims to reduce administrative workload by 90%
      - Hermes automates communication workflows, allowing teachers to easily share updates with parents
        without manual processes
      - The service integrates with Teaching & Curriculum Service (Apollo) to distribute lesson plans and
        resources

   4. Ensuring Data-Driven Decision Making:
      - Communication data collected by Hermes can provide insights into engagement levels between different
        stakeholders
      - The service tracks message delivery and receipt, contributing to the overall analytics capabilities
        of SchoolPilot

   5. Maintaining Security and Compliance:
      - Hermes implements proper authentication via Janus (identity management service)
      - Communication permissions are enforced (e.g., Director ↔ Student communication is prohibited)
      - Session management with 1-hour expiration enhances security
      - Tenant isolation ensures proper data access within multi-school environments

   6. Supporting Multiple Stakeholders:
      - The architecture explicitly supports communication relationships between:
        - Director ↔ Staff (administrative communication)
        - Director ↔ Guardian (administrative updates to parents)
        - Staff ↔ Guardian (daily educational updates)
        - Staff ↔ Student (instructional communication)
        - Group communications for classes or cohorts

   7. Real-time Updates:
      - Aligns with SchoolPilot's promise of "real-time updates" mentioned in the "Parent Communication App"
        section
      - Teachers can immediately share photos, videos, and notes about student activities
      - Push notifications ensure critical updates reach parents promptly

   8. Integrating with Other Services:
      - Hermes acts as a communication hub that connects to all other SchoolPilot services:
        - Athena (Student Management) for progress reports
        - Apollo (Teaching & Curriculum) for lesson plan distribution
        - Janus (Identity Management) for user validation
        - Zeus (Director Management) for administrative communications
        - Hestia (Guardian Management) for parent updates

  ## Technical Architecture Benefits

  The dual subsystem architecture (real-time and async task layers) ensures:
   - Responsive communication without blocking for resource-intensive operations
   - Scalable architecture that can handle high volumes of messages
   - Proper separation of concerns between interactive and background processing
   - Media processing that doesn't impact real-time communication performance

  In summary, Hermes is the backbone of SchoolPilot's communication strategy, directly enabling the
  platform's promise to "strengthen parent-school relationships" and "reduce administrative workload" by
  automating and streamlining communication flows between all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem.
